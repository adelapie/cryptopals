# Crypto Challenge Set 3

This is the next set of **block cipher cryptography challenges** (even
the randomness stuff here plays into block cipher crypto).

This set is **moderately difficult**. It includes a famous attack
against CBC mode, and a "cloning" attack on a popular RNG that can be
annoying to get right.

We've also reached a point in the crypto challenges where all the
challenges, with one possible exception, are valuable in breaking
real-world crypto.
