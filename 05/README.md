# Crypto Challenge Set 5

This is the first set of **number-theoretic cryptography** challenges,
and also our coverage of message authentication.

This set is **significantly harder** than the last set. The concepts
are new, the attacks bear no resemblance to those of the previous
sets, and... math.

On the other hand, **our favorite cryptanalytic attack ever** is in
this set (you'll see it soon). We're happy with this set. Don't wimp
out here. You're almost done!
