# Crypto Challenge Set 7

This is **the first of two sets we generated after the original 6**.

Unlike the last few sets, **this set is a hodge-podge**. It also
includes some of the few challenges we have that probably aren't
useful against real targets (they were fun enough to include anyways).
On the other hand, we also include a challenge that models the CRIME
attack on TLS.

This set is **hard**. There's a significant amount of programming, and
Wang's attack in particular is as difficult as anything we've done.
