# Crypto Challenge Set 8

This is **the second of two sets we generated after the original 6**.

This set focuses on abstract algebra, including DH, GCM, and (most
importantly) elliptic curve cryptography. Fair warning - it's really
tough! There's a ton of content here, and it's more demanding than
anything we've released so far. By the time you're done, you will have
written an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow
implementation of one percent of SageMath.
