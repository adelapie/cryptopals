# CTR bitflipping

There are people in the world that believe that CTR resists bit
flipping attacks of the kind to which CBC mode is susceptible.

Re-implement [the CBC bitflipping exercise from earlier](https://github.com/wasamasa/cryptopals/blob/master/02/16.md) to use CTR
mode instead of CBC mode. Inject an "admin=true" token.
