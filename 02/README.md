# Crypto Challenge Set 2

This is the first of several sets on **block cipher cryptography**. This
is bread-and-butter crypto, the kind you'll see implemented in most
web software that does crypto.

This set is **relatively easy**. People that clear set 1 tend to clear
set 2 somewhat quickly.

Three of the challenges in this set are extremely valuable in breaking
real-world crypto; one allows you to decrypt messages encrypted in the
default mode of AES, and the other two allow you to rewrite messages
encrypted in the most popular modes of AES.
